# United States Immigration Data Analysis
### Data Engineering Capstone Project

#### Project Summary
This projectâ€™s objective was to establish an ETL pipeline for I94 immigration, earth surface temperatures, airport codes, and city demographic datasets to create an analytics data warehouse for US immigration trends.

The tools utilized for this project include **Apache Spark and AWS S3**. Spark will be used to read and process the data and S3 will store the fact and dimension tables created with a Snowflake architecture. 


The project follows the follow steps:
* Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data
* Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data
* Step 3: Define the Data Model
* Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data
* Step 5: Complete Project Write Up
